## Innovative idea:  
Our team is dedicated to developing an online platform for UMASS students who work on-campus to switch or cover shifts. As Umass provides various on-campus job positions, many students take these opportunities to earn skills and money. However, students sometimes may not be able to go to work because of time conflicts, like health issues or midterm exams. In this case, they can post the shift information (job description, time, and location) along with contact methods on Ucover to find colleagues who are willing to cover it. Our website integrates the time resources of students across the whole campus, not just a few friends that you know. Based on the campus employment system, people covering the shift would get paid accordingly. Therefore, for students who are looking for increasing income, Ucover makes it convenient to find on-campus shift covering opportunities.
